I'm a certified Full Stack Dev, (MERN heavy) and general tech enthusiast driven to learn about anything and everything that strikes my interest. 

At the moment I'm in the 2nd year of my bachelor's course (CSE), but my focus is on mastering web3.0 tech and making a name for myself in the space while it's still on the cutting-edge.

The goal is to keep learning by constantly attending hackathons, panels, or community events and working on developing THE next big crypto startup, which is what me and my team are currently working on achieving.

web3 exp:
Currently in my learning stage, no proper work experience or large project yet but working towards sharpening my skills and having something big to showcase within the end of this year
